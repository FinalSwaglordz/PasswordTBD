Final Project

Project Summary: http://students.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/~dhage/

This project reads user input, creates strings of length 1 up to n (which is max length), and returns the calculated string.

The idea is that this can be changed to accept an SHA-1 hash and will brute-force calculate the string which creates that hash.

To compile: c++ VariableLengthSolution1.cpp -o test
To execute: ./test

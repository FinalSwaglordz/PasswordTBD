Final Project

Project Summary: http://students.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/~dhage/

This project reads user input, creates strings of length 1 up to n (which is max length), and returns the calculated string.

The idea is that this can be changed to accept an SHA-1 hash and will brute-force calculate the string which creates that hash. <br>

To compile just type: make<br>
This will compile all of our files and make them executable<br>
There will actually be an Executables folder created for the user<br>
To execute go in to Executables folder and type: ./fileName <br>
